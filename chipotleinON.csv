Just like every other Chipotle, there is a line to get your order in, but this location does seem a little better than most others. The staff feel like they are moving quicker and get through your order to pay faster. The overall line doesn't seem as long as I've seen other locations snake around the food court. Definitely a better location in that sense.

OMERGERRD

i didn't get the experience i had hoped for. first off, i got the burrito bowl cause i figured i would get a tad bit more than just a regular burrito. just the bowl itself with some guac, it came to a whopping $12-13. (like damn $4-5 more and i could've just went to an ayce sushi place LOL)
but yeah

taste wise, i thought it was too salty. at first it's like HELL YEHA THIS THE BOMB but after a while it gets a bit ... salty and i swear i probably chugged all the water from the Niagara Falls CAUSE DAMN THAT BEAST MADE ME THIRSTY AF 

but yeah, oh and the guac was disappointing man like i thought it would taste bomb considering people ALWAYS ask for more but nah man that stuff ain't for me mate. and damn it was like pea sized amount for $2, $2.5? like hell naw that ain't right

one last thing the employees were quite poopy so beware

Got the grilled chicken Burrito Bowl (without guac since I had my avocado fix that morning already) and it was FANTASTIC. Seasoned well, not too greasy, and when I ask for extra lettuce, it's not the here let me give you one additional leaf service you get at sandwich shops... it's the REAL DEAL. My bowl was filled to the brim with sweet corn and lettuce and I have no regrets.

The flavours of Chipotle I can totally see get old if you have it often. Don't frequent this place too much! What makes Chipotle amazing, especially in the GTA, is the fact that there aren't a lot of franchises in the area. Every visit is a rare treat you have to mission for, but at least you know it will be worth :)

Apparently they're all about ingredients with integrity, which means sourcing non-GMO ingredients, responsibly raised meats, etc. I can totally buy into that.

The line was pretty long on a Sunday evening. There was definitely a bottleneck at the cashier because my order had moved down the line quickly and I couldn't hear what they were asking me. I ordered the beef barbacoa bowl with white rice, corn, black beans, lettuce, cheese, and mild sauce. Everything tasted really good. The barbacoa was soft and flavorful, as good as the best barbacoa I've tasted so far. The cilantro-infused white rice was also soft and flavorful. All of the ingredients were definitely fresh.

I was highly anticipating the arrival of Chipotle inside Vaughan Mills as I usually find myself going over to Yorkdale or downtown to satisfy my Chipotle cravings.

This location is on point just as the other locations across the city..large portions, assembly line style of ordering (rice\/meats\/salsas\/sour cream\/cheese\/lettuce). I got my usual half chicken half steak bowl.. delicious! Price is great for the large portion you get (~$10).

Maybe I should open a spring roll restaurant in a posh area and charge nearly double that price to capitalize on these mindless consumerism......oh wait...

I spent over $13 on lunch when I came here with a former co-worker, he said this place was dope. I'm looking at the prices and thought to might self, these better be actual dope if I'm spending this kind of money on such kitsch food!
 
The effing thing was huge, bigger than any roll I have ever...okay you get the idea. It must have been a pound of burrito. Such North American indulgence over even the simplest of things. 
With avocado, the burrito was alright. In my opinion, it is not at all edible without it.
With drink and a side of chips, it was thirteen bucks. THIRTEEN BUCKS!
Since when did tacos become apart of the illustrious yuppie lifestyle?!
They even have a kids menu, which looks like a box lunch you would make for your kids if the main course was a pack of DunkAroos. 
The counter was so white, it didn't even look like a fast food restaurant. 
The website states that they have a philosophy of using healthful ingredients, and being picky with it's source of meat. 
I can use the same philosophy, open a corner hot dog stand, and sell the dogs at six dollars each, justifying it by claiming the dogs were purchased from Pussateri's, or some local farm. The point is; WHO CARES?!
IT'S TACOS!

Take $13, and go to any other restaurant not disillusioned by greed and a culture of conspicuous consumption, and see what you can get for lunch. $13 gets you lunch for two at T&T super market only five minute drive away.
$13 gets you a buffet worth of tacos at Taco Bell. It gets you in a pretentious nightclub on a Friday night anywhere in the city (with coat-check)!
But maybe you want to spent that $13 on a burrito and some chips...

They even have a patio. Burrito goes al fresco. Nice...why don't we go for the full authentic experience and replace the outdoor tables with a loading dock curb, get a broken down truck was spray you with exhaust, and have people standing at the corner dealing crack. I'd pay $13 for that!
And where's the tequila?? You try to find me a dry 'Mexican Grill' in Mexico!
This place is so fake it's a insult to the Mexican people. 

The service here is an awkward conversation, and there are no photos on the menu depicting the food. As if I'm supposed to know what everything is supposed to be. The floor is devoid of any decor whatsoever.

He recommended Chipotle after trying one in the states. The location is pretty good for people working downtown because its right by Union Station. 

When we go there, it was 1 pm on a Friday and the line was still long! I hesitated on staying after seeing the long line, but we decided to stay. I got the feeling the lineup was always long, probably due to the quality and hype it got from the states, and its location. We were at the end of the line, and it took around 8 minutes for our turn to order.

I got a good 'ol chicken burrito, with a mild spice. It wasn't spicy at all, so mild is a good choice for those who cannot handle their spices! I think i can go medium spice next time. The burrito itself was huge, but so good. Tasted pretty healthy too, so i ended up being satisfied afterwards. I also got their chips and medium salsa, which was around $3 which was pretty good, because the amount was pretty large. I really enjoyed their medium salsa - it was spicy, flavourful and refreshing. For my drink i ended up grabbing a beer for around $4.50 (they don't have much of a selection, but it went well with the burrito).

I ordered the spicy steak burrito. The main ingredients were very good and tasty but was missing the heat! I thought there might at least be a little kick to it but it never came. Guacamole was an extra $2.20 and seemed to be quite bland and boring.

With your choice of meat (chicken, steak, or pork), beans (black or pinto), and rice (brown or white) and all the trimmings (mild, medium, or hot sauce; lettuce, grilled veggies, corn, and guac) there are so many variations.  I think the highlight is the tortilla which is large and pliable but manages to keep all the delicious fillings contained and minimizes mess (in case you're, let's say, riding the GO while eating). You can also forgo the tortilla and have a bowl with rice and salad instead. Great value at just over $10 as it's quite filling and well balanced.

I scoped out the menu beforehand to prepare myself. That didn't take too long since it's pretty simple-burritos, burrito bowls or salad. You line up and it's assembled in front of you assembly line style. There aren't a ton of options-rice, meats (steak (2 types), carnitas (pork) and chicken), some vegetables, beans, rice and toppings like salsa, guacamole and sour cream.

The restaurant is shiny and open with benches and stools. It's not really set up for a leisurely meal. The people taking orders seemed to be more accustomed to people getting stuff to take away too. I went with salad to save the 290 calories of the tortilla and my friend is on a paleo kick so wanted a kind of salad bowl without the lettuce but with extra meat and guacamole. I thought the server's head might explode from being asked to deviate from the strict set menu but she kind of managed. They were reasonably quick and not unfriendly, although I can't say I felt like they were thrilled to see me!

We ended up with 2 salad bowls-his with guacamole and we decided on tap water to drink for a total of $24. Gulp. These were not huge meals, by the way. They were moderate sized and served in cardboard containers. We were given cups for our water and waved over to the self serve drinks machine area. Between the 2 of us, we absolutely could not figure out where the water was and had to go back to ask. In case you'd like some, it's the teeny tiny silver button just over the Nestea one. It would have been easier to steal some Diet Coke really.

I have been a huge fan of Chipotle since I was living in Denver a while ago, which is where it was originated. It was my weekly treat.
For such a large city as Toronto, I think there is a lack of burrito places and what we have is rather disappointing (Burrito Boys, Z Teca, etc.), and I think Chipotle is still the best.
My positive review of the Yonge & Dundas location also applies to this new location.

The decor is departure from the plywood, conduit pipe and corregated steel interiors of the other restaurants. It looks more modern, brighter and upscale. The only down side is that it doesn't pack enough seating.

The food is always good, the meats are humanely raised and hormone free and freshly grilled. The only change is that they now offer a brown rice option which a great plus if you are trying to avoid processed grains like white rice. My favorites are the grilled chicken and the stewed pulled pork.
I always get the hot salsa which has a decent amount of heat, and I also shake some of the great chipotle flavoured Tobasco sauce which the smokey flavour makes any food come to life. If I see a bottle of this in the supermarket I will be sure to get it -- it's that good.

Chipotle is an awesome well-rounded, filling meal, with fresh ingredients, and it's quick.  So it's the perfect solution for a pre-game or pre-concert meal, right between the ACC and Rogers Center.  Even with a long line-up, the service is speedy (albeit, maybe a bit *too* speedy, as there is a lack of personality and customer service with this speediness).

I do find they go a bit light on some ingredients, and heavier on others, making it not quite the right balance compared with the U.S. portions I've had.  I always get the vegetarian burrito bowl, and I find it perfectly satisfying.

The steak meat were actual chunks however I did encounter some really chewy\/stringy bits that didn't digest well. Added chips and salsa was enough for both to share and take home too!

I call bull, I've had Chipotle in Michigan, NY State, Georgia, Pennsylvania, it is exactly the same.  Though I will say the Square One location is lacking. They have no love, weak portions, getting wrong two out of the 3 things why people love this restaurant.  As for the 3rd reason, taste, Chipotle's food is always fresh.  No MSG or any of it's other dubious names  'natural flavours' etc.  It's pure, well made food and none of it is GMO (yay no GMO corn), or mass factory farmed meat, hence a bit more expensive.   

We bailed on all the other burrito places when Chipotle's came to Toronto, as it is just fresher, purer, filling, and zero bloated, sluggish feeling after.  Clearly less salt is used here too, a restaurant staple to create flavour when poor quality ingredients create none.  But Chipotle doesn't require over spicing

This one is a bit far from my work, but I decided to walk the distance to try it. Conclusion: worst burrito place ever.

It was my first time trying Chipotle and when I got to the cashier, my bowl looked extremely small. I disregarded and thought that was how it was supposed to be. I didn't even have a reference because people in front of me ordered burritos. As I'm eating my meal, I tell my friend about how the portions are very small at Chipotle and she says that I'm actually missing not one, not two, but THREE ingredients that they're supposed to included at no extra charge (veggies consisting of onion and pepper, corn, and lettuce).

I look over at the counter and indeed, an employee was dumping lettuce onto everyone else's order. I don't understand how someone could've fucked up so bad as to miss 3 crucial ingredients that's supposed to be in the bowl. 

I then go to Yelp and I see that I'm not the only one who experienced this! I unfortunately didn't get to take a photo, but there is one already posted on Yelp. The caption is From my friends snapchat, as he was surprised at my tiny bowl. Both were same price and instructions.

I suspect they are doing this deliberately to some customers in hopes that they won't notice the missing ingredients. This wouldn't work on anyone who goes to Chipotle often, but it definitely fooled me, since I was a first-timer.

- the ability to customize

The cons:
- it is way too expensive for what you get
- I've gotten it several times but it just doesn't match up to the NYC version
- they do not put enough!!!!! everything is way too measured and when you open up the burrito bowl container you almost want to shed a little tear cause you are wondering where the rest of it went
- they almost make you feel a little guilty for asking for a little bit more
- omg I can't even talk about the tacos; yes they give you three but there was more of the shell than toppings
- I tried the carnitas and barbacoa and it wasn't good at all; they made the entire dish just soggy

The placed was busy, we managed find a table but a dirty one... there were dried sauce on it and hard to remove it when I tried to clean with my own wet naps. Besides the line to order, there is also a line up to the washrooms.

Price was not reasonable for the quality of food. Well, downtown price, right? We had burritos which were average size nothing special about it. Maybe we should order taco or naked burritos like most of people. But still, the kids meal were 6$ which should call a toddler meal - tiny quesadilla with a juice box and 2 sides. It wasn't enough for a 8 years old. The side rice was hard and bland and the side bean was bland too and little spicy. I know that for $6 @ Burrito Boyz, we can feed 2 kids. The quality of the burritos and the price (chicken burritos) were definitely better at Burrito Boyz.

Definitely not consider coming back this place, maybe we will try other location instead.

At first, when they piled the rice into the bowl, I thought it was a pretty small amount, but once they piled all the meat and toppings onto it, it filled up pretty quick actually. In fact, it lasted me 2 meals, though I'm not that big of an eater.

I also promise that Chipotle has not offered me any stock options or even a free side of guac for this review.

Here are some points for those who may not have tried this yet ...

1. They have a limited selection if burritos, tacos, and a bowl. (Burrito without the tortilla shell). They offer pork , beef, chicken, and a vegetarian option called safritas.
2. The bowls and burritos are 8.95$ before tax. The burritos and bowls are both huge and made with ingredients that are usually organic or from animals that are farmed with care, which is more than most similar places can claim. For some people, this is apparently the same price as a meal at Canoe.
3. The guac costs an extra 2.21$. It is made in house. 
4. Toppings that do not incur an extra charge include grilled peppers and onions, salsas, corn, pinto or black beans, shredded cheese, lettuce, and sour cream. They have a choice of three Tabasco sauce flavours as well.
5. The staff at this location seem to be friendlier than at the other location on Yonge. They also don't seem to try to skimp on ingredients like the Yonge location sometimes does.
6. The burritos and bowls are delicious. You will be hard pressed to find a better burrito anywhere in Toronto.
7. They offer unsweetened tea for those who like sugar free iced tea in the summer. (It is in the metal container by the fountain drink station.)
8. They sell bottled beers and a margarita as well.
9. With the 13% tax, a bowl and a drink is $12.20.

Me and my friends all ordered chicken bowls. First thing I noticed was that I got half as much chicken as both the person in front of and behind me (they were both my friends). 

Also, when they asked for what I wanted I asked for everything. I saw what my two friends ordered and what really upset me was they both got corn and lettuce and I got...  A sliver of cheese and sour cream? 

I've attached a picture of two bowls for comparison which were the same price. The lettuce might make it more exaggerated but trust me when I say I received significantly less meat.

So went in around 7:30 on Friday. There were only a couple people eating and a couple more in line ahead of us. The service was friendly, however, they literally scrapped the last bits of meat (chicken for myself, beef for my friend) into our burrito bowls. There's nothing wrong with the meat, but it would have been nice to get some freshly cooked meat along with the last bits of the previous container.

Also the portions scooped into our respective bowls was a bit on the lesser side than the other locations I frequent. Do people in this area just enjoy spending more and getting less than other areas? Was this a one time thing? Not sure. I definitely don't enjoy getting small portions when I'm spending so much (and adding extra for guac).

Then my friend wanted chips and she got salsa instead of guac. I can't recall for sure but I think the price difference is somewhere from $0.50-1.00 in the two options. But the salsa is literally the stuff they put in your burrito and as the mild one is basically chopped tomatoes is very difficult to scoop out of the container with the chip. So I would suggest not going for the salsa. The guac is pricy. They like to charge more for it. But it tastes so good. Nowhere else makes a guac this good (from my experience) so I would rather shell out the extra coins for it. Also the chips were disgustingly over salted. I've had chips and guac at another location and it was a decent amount of salt but this bag of chips... Oh dear.

One more thing, I'm not sure if I missed it, but it looks like this location only has one disposal area for customers... I was literally running around with garbage for 2 mins.

So for all the above I would give this location 3 stars. But then I visited the washroom. And it was out of toilet paper. I could have just made use of the paper towels for drying your hands. But instead I went to the cash and let one of the employees know. Within 5 mins she went and put in new rolls. This is what gets this location the extra star. They were friendly while serving food, and they listened and followed through on a complaint. Good service will always get you a star with me!

I probably won't be back here again. I don't frequent this area and I prefer a couple of the other locations anyway.

I have my favourites (Chorizo in the burbs, and Bandidos downtown) but lately I've been all about the burrito bowl from Chipotle. 

Most burrito joints I go for bean and cheese, with all of the fillings I tend to find the meat takes over (plus I'm getting some protein in the beans), but Chipotle's steak has really impressed me. It's always perfectly cooked with some pink on the inside! The reason I go for the bowl here is that they don't grill the burritos so I find the tortilla a bit too chewy and unnecessary on the calorie front. The bowl comes with rice (white or brown - I usually go for white), beans (black for me), salsa (the spicy red tomatillo is truly fantastic, hot but super flavourful as well), and then lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and I pay the RIDICULOUS 2.25 for guacamole too. To me guac is a necessary burrito topping and should be included everywhere.

Anyways this is a super filling meal but incredibly tasty. You can split it over two meals for sure and at least you rest easy knowing the ingredients are fresh and the meat is local. 

I'm a regular at the Front St. location but I have to say the Yonge location, albeit way busier, has better service.

Ah well I walked in at this spot at an off peak hour and the place had a manageable crowd. I ordered two  Barbacoa\/chicken burrittos sans the rice and beans (people would say that's more of a fajita but hey my food my choice) thinking I can try the other one later. Added the guac which looks freshly made and whole bunch of other toppings.
First off maybe I didn't add the beans\/rice so the size of the burrito wasn't what I am used to as it was a lot smaller. Taste was decent (to be fair I have a higher expectation of Mexican food having lived in Nor Cal for years). Hmm I would say surely above a fast food level spot.

Instead of getting a burrito (which would be my usual inclination) I decided to go with their burrito bowl (forgoing the tortilla). It was basically all the veggies and cheese and such in a big bowl, i.e. the stuff that normally would go into the burrito. Being a vegetarian, I went with their Sofritas which is this braised tofu thing, mixed with spices and poblano peppers. Tasty enough but not the best meat replacement I've had in a burrito. 

Anyways, even though the thing looked like a huge mess, it was quite tasty...at first. As I went on, it really began to lose its luster and I found myself struggling to finish it. No idea why...this doesn't usually happen to me with similar Mexican fast food. So it was so-so, I suppose.

Almost everyone else has mentioned the ridiculous guacamole surcharge and I noticed that right away as well, before reading any other reviews. I know it's often extra (though better places like Burrito Boyz include it in the price) but $2.21 is easily the most I've ever seen outside of a sit down restaurant. Highway robbery.
 
So as much as it pains me to say, I think that the next time I'm in Square One and craving a burrito, I'm going to have to go with Taco Bell.

The Square One location is the worst one to go to & it hasn't even been open for long. I've been to the Yonge\/Dundas & Yorkdale locations & each have very long line ups but the quality of the food is never compromised. I don't mind waiting for food but I mind waiting for bad food. 

My boyfriend & I have eaten twice at the Square One location & both times we were disappointed. First time we ate there in the first week it open so understandably the line was long.. But the line of food prep was rushed & they weren't even listening to customers. My boyfriend asked for a barbacoa burrito & the guy gave him carnitas instead. When I pointed it out the guy insisted what he put was barbacoa until I pointed at the barbacoa & asked So what's that? A dark carnitas??? & he realized he messed up yet he never apologized...

They were so swamped & can't seem to deal with the rush of customers because they load the burrito in the sloppiest way possible - so sloppy that when you start to eat your burrito it's so soggy it falls apart even before you get towards the end. I have never had that problem with the other locations. 

Today we went for lunch around 2:00pm & the line was barely moving... Again, it seems as though they cannot cope with the rush. I also realized today: THEY ONLY HAVE ONE CASH REGISTER. That is VERY inefficient & probably a big reason why the line never moves. Once again we ordered burritos which again were poorly put together. They were sloppy & soggy. I recommend you guys eat at either Yorkdale or Yonge\/Dundas locations... You will notice the difference in quality. 

The taste of the food is there - no doubt. But if you want to eat a soggy falling apart burrito with your hands covered in sauce & juices because the staff don't care how the burritos are put together, eat at the Square One location.

Anyone who thinks this is a really great burrito has obviously never been to Chorizo or El Sombrero. Chipotle is probably on a quality level with Burrito Boyz, which I consider a truly average burrito. 

I tried the chicken burrito with black beans. The tortilla was one of the worst burrito tortillas I've ever had. It was kind of rubbery in texture and it had no flavour. I barely got much chicken because they had reached the bottom of the chicken warming pan and they were scraping out little dried bits of chicken to put on my burrito. Right in front of me. Yeah, thanks. 

The worst thing about this burrito was the black beans. They scoop out a spoonful of black beans and slop it on your burrito with all the bean water. My whole burrito was a wet, soggy mess because of all the bean liquid. Use a slotted spoon for goodness sake. Bean liquid is not a burrito topping that anyone willingly chooses. Geez. 

I can't comment on the $2.21 guacamole because I'm not an idiot who pays $2.21 for a spoonful of guacamole.

I start to give my order, and he indicates I'm in the wrong spot. I needed to have my food made then pay. I walk to the other end and stand in front of a girl that had been there the whole time. Would it not have been common courtesy to say, When you've decided what you want, come see me at the end sir? But maybe I'm just grouchy cuz I'm hungry. 
I ordered a steak burrito, white rice,  black beans, guacamole, corn, and medium heat. What a mess. The steak was good. The rice was stone cold. Not room temperature, chilled. I'm assuming that's how they serve it.(?) The rest was blah and wet. The tortilla was soaked and the whole thing started to fall apart immediately. These guys have never heard of slotted spoons? I had to hold it with one hand and eat the filling with a fork as the tortilla disintegrated into a glutinous mess. So the burrito is out.

The thing I like about chipotle is the fresh and flavourful ingredients but the thing I don't like is the extra charges for topping and they don't grill their burritos (like burrito boys). Grilling your burritos make the outside warm and crisp while the inside is soft and chewy. Nonetheless this weekend I decided to try chipotle again and have a salad Bowl instead. 

The chicken salad bowl is really something to be reckoned with. The vegetable are fresh, the peppers\/onions are grilled, they have various salsa and I really like the corn salsa with cilantro. I saw them dicing the grilled chicken on the cutting board and I got excited. Nice chunks if flavourful grilled chicken. Not some pre frozen, pre cut bland stuff that a lot of chains use. So from now on when I get dragged to chipotle I'm going to stick with the bowl. Hopefully they start grilling their burritos in the future

a) Why are you charging me $2.21 for guacomole?  I should get an entire bowl for this price, not just a few tablespoons.  

b) Why is a veggie burrito\/bowl the same price as meat? Shouldn't it be cheaper?  

c) Paying almost $14 (tax included) for a burrito bowl plus a pop is way too much.   

However, one thing I did like was the Chipotle sauce which added flavour to the bowl.  Otherwise, it as average, but the pricing is just nuts.  Burrito Boyz is way cheaper and better. If I want to pay $14 for a meal, I'd just go have sushi instead.

First off as my own personal opinion, I don't compare chipotle to burrito boyz. I think they are both equally as good. 
I love how chipotle burritos aren't warmed with everything melted together, that's burrito boyz' specialty. 
It's nice that it's slightly warm with all the cool, refreshing toppings inside. The meat is very tasty (I only get chicken). Although, I find the mild salsa very spicy, should be relabelled as medium-hot.. Or maybe I just can't handle the heat! One thing I don't like is how they don't mash their beans, it's just whole beans  in your burrito... Blah no thanks.

I was pleasantly surprised by their friendly staff that helped me with my order. 
I ordered:

-a mix of the Carnitas (shredded pork meat) and their Barbacoa (shredded beef) It was delicious and perfectly braised. I was glad that the meat was not tough and dry, instead if was moist and full of flavor.

- black beans (I was told it was more nutritious than the pinto, which has more flavor)

-brown rice (was not a fan...)

-salsa verde (medium heat) this was amazing, perfect amount of spicyness and tangy flavour.

-Guacamole (NOT IMPRESSED, because I was charged approx. $2.21 for a rather small amount.

-Sour cream

-Romaine lettuce

-Tortilla (Not impressed)

Overall: 
-My favorite part of the burrito was the meat, but the Tortilla would have tasted better toasted. It ended up being chewy and a bit soggy from all the sauces inside. 

-Also, it really bothered me that they charged so much for their guacamole.

-I also would have liked it if they had a Fish option!

-The burrito is pretty large, it may be a good idea to share if you are not super hungry

-Also ask for a container since its a littly drippy (I actually ended up eating with a fork and knife in the container)

I went early on Victoria Day so I did not have to wait in line! Looked like they had just opened as their fajita vegetables just came out.

Brand spanking new, one of the feature walls hasn't been finished yet...so it's still a work in progress (at least I hope they don't think that stained plywood with cutouts for speakers is acceptable).
If you've ever been to a Chipotle in the U.S. of A, you know what to expect...if you're a Chiptle virgin, this is the scoop:
You walk up to the counter...select either a burrito, a bowl or salad, pick your meat, pick your toppings..then head to the cashier to pay. Pretty straight forward. What sets it apart are the meat seasonings and choice of cilantro-lime rice (either brown or white), pinto or black beans, corn salsa, etc.
The meat (I've done the chicken, steak, pork...in the US) is seasoned perfectly...it's really flavourful and is the main ingredient, so being tasty helps. The cheese has got a rich rich flavour (not like some places that have mystery bland cheese) and the other ingredients are fresh.
For this visit I ordered a chicken burrito, white cilantro-lime rice, pinto beans, cheese, mild and hot salsa (the mild is chunky, the hot is a sauce) and lettuce. The burrito was stuffed to the limit and oh-so good.

Compared to my usual locations at Front St, Yonge\/Dundas, Yorkdale, and Vaughan Mills, this one is at the bottom in terms of overall quality.

Firstly, it is a fairly new location, so I do like the exterior\/interior, the bathrooms are pretty good, etc. They also had proper credit\/debit card terminals that take tap\/Apple Pay, finally, vs their other locations being credit (swipe--yay for having your card compromised!) or cash only, no debit.

The downsides are the quality of some of the ingredients, and the service. The steak was disgusting--cooked easily twice as long as it should have been, most chipotles cook to a medium\/medium well, this was well-well-well-well-well done. Dessicated and hard, I ended up picking 80% of the steak out of my burrito and throwing it out, it was completely inedible. The chips are also vastly inferior to the chips at any other Chipotle--bland and stale every time. And one minor thing--they don't allow customers to get their own knives from the cutlery area. All 5 cutlery containers are labelled 'forks' only. You have to go back and ask the cashier for a knife--a tiny little plastic knife that has serious difficulty cutting their clumpy rice. Most chipotles just have them by the forks.

As for the service, they are chronically understaffed, and the employees are never in any hurry. Chipotle addicts will groan at that--one of the best things about Chipotle is how, despite the often long lines, the employees work hard and things move quickly. I went for dinner today around 6PM and there was a single employee working the entire line--bowls\/tortillas, rice\/meat, salsas, and cash, everything. There was one other employee in the back. They were completely out of veggies and chicken, that I knew of, maybe other things too; I had to wait about 10 minutes for their single kitchen employee to get more chicken out, then the single line employee was going all the way down to cashing people out then coming back, etc...took forever.

I will say, however, that the chicken was quite good, and the overall quality of the bowl, while still far below most Chipotles, was decent. The rice was somewhat clumpy and bland, but the black beans were excellent, veggies were good (when they had any), and the chicken was great. The guac is a standout--it was actually well above the chipotle average for guac; though the stale chips kind of kill it.

The avocado they use is fresh. However, I feel I always need one more container with the amount of chips given.

After last week's pulled pork burrito from Chipotle at Yonge\/Eglinton, I'm just thankful I didn't ask for guacamole - that would've cost me a nearly additional $3 to my already pricey burrito.  The reason why I won't go here again is how my husband put it so succinctly - it is not good value to eat here.  After you buy your 2 burritos sans guacamole, and 2 bottle fizzy drinks, you're looking at paying over $25 for two.  The reason why I'd chose Quesada over Chipotle is because Quesada slaps the burrito under a flat pressed panini grill thus giving the tortilla a crispness that I love and adore.

When k went in today, most of the staff was sitting down or out back smoking.

The avocado was a funky brown

And my burrito had to be remade cause the guy couldn't remember my type of rice and that I asked for barbacoa. 

Worse Bit- the burrito really didn't taste good. At all. I picked at it and three out half.

Only thing this spot gets right is open concept dining layout, and plenty of outdoor seating. 

Sigh. That's what I get for going for junk food I guess. 

I RECOMMEND- walking further up for some real Mexican food

I have struggled to find a good Mexican place after coming here from California and while Chipotle might not be authentic, it definitely fixes the (very frequent) burrito cravings I get. I love that a lot of their ingredients are organic or naturally raised, and that the food is handmade in the restaurants.

People seem to disagree with me on this but I'm not a fan of putting the burrito into the panini press after it's made. I find that it heats up the lettuce and salsa inside and ruins the mix of textures that a burrito is supposed to have. Chipotle is the only burrito place I've come across Toronto that does not do this.

Eating at Chipotle can be healthy, You can get your burrito fixin's on a bed of lettuce. Skip the cheese, sour cream, rice, and beans and you have something that won't kill you. Or you can just limit your Chipotle exposure to the occasional craving. You'll want to pursue the latter option. 

Chipotle's own website advises that the menu is short. Protein choices include braised carnitas or beef barbacoa, adobo-marinated and grilled chicken or steak. A vegetarian option loads you up on beans and bean byproducts. A healthy portion of rice (healthier if you skip the tortilla and order it as a bowl), black or pinto beans, cheese and sour cream round out the order. Fresh salsas bring brightness; I combine the mellow corn, lively pico de gallo and hot versions, for variety's sake. The Tabasco family is well-represented on a side board, should you require more heat. Guacamole costs 2 bucks extra. It's tasty but unless you're dying for an avocado fix, you won't miss it. Cost is the same whether you order a burrito, bowl, salad, or hard\/soft taco. Go classic.  

Chipotle offers a surprising variety of beverage options, including beer and margaritas. It's also one of the few Toronto restaurants of any price point to offer unsweetened iced tea. Limitless non-sugary refills alone are worth a visit. 

What Chipotle has going for and against it is bulk. I'm a huge burrito fan. I write this after polishing one off for lunch.

So I decided to end the dry spell by losing my Chipotle virginity.

I went the take-out route (since it's around the corner from my place) and ordered the chicken fajita (sauteed bell peppers and onions instead of beans; medium salsa; sour cream, tomatoes, lettuce and cheese).

Let me tell you something. This burrito was big. And it was baaad. And by baaad, I mean AWESOME.

The chicken was flavourful, and all the toppings went well together, even though - when it was being prepared - it looked a big excessive.

I think this place MAY be better than Quesada or Burrito Boyz.

The only reasons I've deducted a star are:

(1) I didn't eat on the premises, and I think I should, to get the full experience.

(2) Why doesn't Chipotle have the option of getting a whole-wheat tortilla when ordering a burrito?

(3) Chipotle burritos only seem to come in one size: huge. 
Unless you've got the metabolism of an athlete, *or* you really ARE **so** hungry that you'd eat a horse, this kind of meal is filling. 
Yes, there are other options (tacos, burritos bowls, etc.). But if you're specifically craving a burrito and don't want to feel like you're training for a competitive eating contest, there should be a half-sized option.

- This is *kind of* an expensive burrito. But I think that can be explained by the fact this burrito was friggin' enormous.

While I was on business in Toronto I was playing tourist and decided to pop in and give it a try. I am a big guy and decided I would grab a rice bowl and a burrito to bring back to the hotel for later. 

The place was busy- the line moved quick though. I told them what I wanted and was extremely disappointed as I saw the employees make my food- tiny meat portions. Tiny is not even adequate, pathetic measly meat portions. 

I get to the till and am asked to pay 23$ for this tiny amount of food, whatever I think- at least my company is paying for it- but wait! They don't take debit( the cashier rudely tells me- probably also because I have a look of shock on my face. ) credit or cash only, I only brought my debit with me. I ask where the nearest debit is and am told its across the street. 

What kind of establishment doesn't take debit? It's the same machine as credit?!?!? Sooo stupid. Anyways, I'm fully preparing to go across to the ATM when a coworker calls me from back at the hotel and asked if I want to go out for dinner...well, ACTUALLY yes I do. I let that ripoff excuse of a restaurant to deal with my chihuahua portioned snacks and headed to a restaurant that guess what? TOOK DEBIT. 

Ps- I ended up grabbing some Burrito's from a spot called Bandito Burritos ( I think) while I was in town. Amazing, fresh, tasty, large portions and TOOK DEBIT! Imagine that.

If you visit enough times, there are times that the chicken will be dry and the rice isn't cooked properly but it's not too much of an issue.

The burritos are big, and you can stuff them with all kinds of veggies, meat, and condiments.

They have all the main ingredients that a good burrito should have, getting a burrito is much better than the platter. If you are going to try something close to authentic Mexican food get the burrito, which is how this particular dish is served in Mexico.

I've noticed this Chipotle place near where one of my closest friends lives, also near some of my favourite other places to eat so about a month ago we decided to drop in and try it out. We were actually quite surprised by the burrito bowls. For what you pay there is a really good amount of food and it also tastes pretty darn good. If it speaks to the place, we have returned 3 more times in the last month so that should say something.

I'm also a calorie and macro-nutrient tracker and the Burrito Bowl here offers a very good mix of macro-nutrients without piling on the calories like many other restaurants. This place is a GREAT post workout stop.

Well, whatever the reason, I can't help but heart Chipotle!!!   

All options are priced the same - be it chicken, steak, pork, or veggie - be it burrito, fajita, taco, or bol.   WIth the veggie, you get free guacamole.  I think the price for one serving is around the $8 range.  

There are four types of mouthwatering salsas (corn, tomato, mild, and spicy) and you can ask for all 4 of them to be included in your meal.  You are not limited!!!

I remember hearing that the pinto beans are not vegetarian because they are cooked with some sort of animal fat but the black beans are a vegetarian option.

The chips seem to be prepared fresh on site.  I saw a woman frying up a batch and sprinkling them with salt and lime juice.  Not a huge fan of the chips - but then again, I am not a huge fan of tortilla chips in general.  

For some reason, my meal seemed smaller than my chipotle meals in the states ... not sure if it is just my imagination or what.  I still felt a tiny bit hungry after finishing my burrito whereas I normally feel pretty satisfied.  

The ingredients seem so simple yet when put together, you get a delicious mouth party.  Yum!!!

But... that's it. No offer of compensation at all, not even 50% off for my next order or something. Which - considering their prices - makes me not want to go there any more.

I lived in Europe for a couple of years, so imagine my immense pleasure when I a Chipotle on Yonge Street near Yonge and Dundas square. Sure there have been a few health scares at Chipotle in the last few days, but I chose to block that particular piece of information from my mind when I decided to go in. :)

The good: The burrito. And the size of the burrito. 
I got the chicken burrito like I always do, no beans. And it was as delicious as I remembered it, perhaps even more so. So no complaints there whatsoever. And they were REALLY generous with their portion sizes at this location. I remember being able to eat one of their burritos fairly easily in the States but the one I got here could fill up two people easily, no kidding.

The bad: The place is super busy. 
I went there on a Friday evening and the queue was super long. The staff moved things along as fast as they could, but it still took me 15 in the lines minutes till I could place my order. Not sure if anything can be done to remedy that since the place is super popular.
And oh, the chips were cold and way too salty.

Also, you can feel good knowing your food comes from a wholesome source. I recommend you check out their website to learn about their sustainable food sourcing, and strict standards for using non-hormonal, antibiotic-free, etc. etc. kind of meat. They call it Food with Integrity.

(I tried to talk myself into getting a burrito bowl once but my subconscious kicked in and I choked on the word bowl when I got to the counter.) The thing I've noticed about the vegetarian burrito is, there are days when fried peppers and onions are included automatically and there are days when they will ask whether or not you want them. There are days when my burrito baby is plump, bursting with lots of creamy guacamole and a mess to eat and there are days when my little bundle of joy is leaner and easy to wolf down. After much thought, I have finally come to the conclusion that Chipotle burritos are inconsistently prepared, but consistently delicious.

Chipotle may not be authentic Mexican cuisine - call it Tex-Mex or Cali-style or whatever - but it's pretty freakin' good. If I can remember correctly from when I was there this past week, all burritos are $8, but vegetarians can get guacamole for free (otherwise it's $2 extra). Portions are huge, and unless you have a wicked-fast metabolism will likely keep you full for a long time. It's almost always really busy and seating can be limited, not to mention some of the tables are super small. Not recommended for a first date, unless maybe you're going out with a burrito boy.

I love you so much. I love how your bags are made from 100% post consumer waste, 90% for your napkins. I love the way you cook your steak and the seasoning you use for it. I love how you add lime and cilantro to your rice. I love all your salsas. I love that all your meats are from hormone and antibiotic-free animals who are treated humanely. And that the cheese and sour cream comes from animals treated under the same humane conditions. I love every detail that you have put into your restaurant(s) right down to the back of your receipt paper. 

I still remember my first steak bowl like it was yesterday... One bite and I was done for. 

I have only been to your Yonge and Dundas location, so I can't really compare the service and food to any of your other locations, but I just wanted to let you know that every one there is doing a great job. The food is consistently delicious and fresh.  The service is always fast, efficient, and given with a smile.  The restaurant and bathrooms are always clean. I really do enjoy eating your food.

The ingredients taste relatively fresh and healthy compared to other burrito options.  Perhaps too fresh, I wonder - my GF just pointed out that the guacamole on the leftover half of her burrito bowl that she's saving for lunch tomorrow didn't turn brown, despite sitting for a while.

The portions are large and the food is quite tasty in general.  I also like that the nutritional information is available in detail on their website.

There is plenty of seating at this location.  This is an advantage compared to my other burrito favourites - all of which are holes in the wall with little to no seating.

On the other hand, the cost is higher compared to the alternatives.  At $8.95 for a burrito bowl before tax, it's more expensive than similar establishments.  Also, if you would like to add guacamole to your burrito it's $2.95 for anything other than the veggie burrito.  This seems excessive to me.  Does it really cost so much to produce?

Also, the person who asked me what ingredients I wanted had an accent so thick that I couldn't really understand what she was saying.  I don't think it's a good idea to have someone who can't pronounce English words in the position that requires the most communication at Yonge and Dundas square.

Likes:

-The fact that they have Beef Barbacoa (seasoned shredded beef) and Carnitas (seasoned braised pork) as meat items for burritos instead of the traditional chicken and steak. 

-Choice of salsa, 1 mild, 2 medium, and one hot. 

-Naturally raised meat (or so they say)

-beer!

-Great location right at Yonge and Dundas. 

-corn in the burrito!

-The music playing last time I ordered was some serious fusion including vocals from Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. 

-Sleek, user-friendly, interactive, and current website. 


Dislikes:

-All the meat I have tried always needs more salt, and no I'm not some salt fiend, it simply is not salted well leaving the meat fairly bland despite the additional seasonings they use.  

-The burritos are huge and sloppy, so huge that one side is cold with the salsa, sour cream and corn etc, and the other side is warm with the meat and rice. 

- They don't grill the burritos after they are put together further contributing to the sloppiness. The tortilla is very thin and chewy, nothing special. 

-Chicken is typically burnt\/charred. I don't ever order the chicken but my g\/f does and I can clearly see that she is often provided with blackened chicken. Sure, I understand there's great flavour in flame grilling chicken, but don't burn it and pull this Nando's flex.

-I had stomach cramps after my last burrito and I never get stomach cramps. I often joke that I can eat anything as my stomach is lined with adamentium. 

-The guac I make blows Chipotle's clear out of the water (feel free to msg me 4 recipe)


I KNOW I am not the first to say this, but this place does not hold a candle to Burrito Boys. I have eaten Burritos all over the city and NOTHING compares to a Burrito Boys burrito, nothing. What do they do that is so special? They do have signature sauces that add serious flavour. But most importantly, they grill their burritos for what seems like an eternity when you're standing in line awaiting your order. This seals in all the flavour from all corners, browns the tortilla and completely heats up\/fuses all the contents of the burrito.

Basically take a flour tortilla, steam it to make it malleable, then load it up with meat, veggies, and sauces, and wrap it up in some tin foil to keep it both undetectable from the reptoid's listening post on the far side of the moon and from exploding all over your white Brooks Brothers shirt.

It gets especially busy at lunch time so you're best to head there a little early for faster service.

I've been here before and always go for the hard tacos, they're delicious and my favourite! You get three hard tacos with filling of your choice and toppings. The chicken is great, very tender and flavourful and today I tried the sofritas for the first time. They were delicious however probably not the best with the hard tacos. By the time I got to the second taco, the sofritas had made the bottom soggy and the tacos fell apart. Still delicious, but stick to chicken or another meat for hard taco shells.

The mild salsa is not really salsa, its more cold chopped tomatoes with onions and cilantro. Good, but not quite salsa. The medium is too spicy for my tastes but is much more like a salsa but still quite liquidy. I always get an order of nachos, they've got some kind of limeish coating on them which is good when you start eating them but gets old pretty fast by the time you get to the end of the bag. Always fresh and good, but I could do without the lime flavor, or be given a choice to have regular nachos.

They always charge extra for guac and they are NOT stingy with it if you get it. That being said, I found the sheer amount of it overpowered the tacos and I ended up taking quite a lot of it off and eating it with the nachos instead. I'd suggest you skip guac on your taco or burrito but get some for the nachos. With the lime flavored nachos it was delicious.

I only have two things I dislike about this place: the ridiculously long lineups and the exorbitant price point of eating here. For hard tacos with quac, an order of nachos and salsa and a drink, it was over $17. It's a good amount of food but I feel like they tack on lots of extras to drive your bill up.

I almost always get the vegetarian burrito (sometimes the bowl). I just like how it tastes all wrapped up in one delicious package. My recommendation (for real vegetarians) is to leave the peppers off because I find they taste like meat (probably cooked on the same grill). My old faithful is a whole wheat burrito with brown rice, black beans, mild salsa, cheese, lettuce and guac. Om nom nom.

This Chipotle store itself is very clean and efficient. They get through the line quickly, you can usually find somewhere to sit and the tables are usually clean. They also have decent bathrooms which are helpful to de-burrito after you have finished. It is also in a good location near Eaton Center and Dundas Station.

I find it surprising that a lot of Canadians haven't heard of Chipotle (they think you are referring to the sauce). I guess it isn't as common as it is in the states where you can throw a rock and hit one (kind of like Starbucks and McDonalds).

I've seen the signs for Chipotle Mexican Grill, but I had yet to try one, until recently. I loved it, but the kids? Not so much. My sister and I stopped by after her kids had soccer practice one day with everyone in tow. I thought it would be a big hit with everyone, and with the adults, it was. 

First of all, the ambiance was good.  Picking what I wanted on my burrito made my mouth start to water just looking at all the choices. I loved the fact I could choose what kind of beans I wanted (black or re-fried) and the low-fat options (like low-fat sour cream) that came along with it.The ingredients were decently fresh and it didn't taste like it had been sitting in a giant vat for hours, waiting to be scooped up on my plate, as it feels like in so many of the copy cat (or Canadian) Mexican restaurants you go into. I already know that the next time I go, I want to try the Burrito Bowls as they look scrumptious. 

But when it came to the kids, things just didn't go as well. About the only thing I can say is that they liked their sodas. They picked at the rice because it had green flecks (cilantro lime) in it, they didn't like the fact that I ordered them hard taco shells instead of soft ones (my bad), they didn't like the fact you didn't get refills on the chips like you do in sit-down restaurants, etc. The list goes on.

I usually get a salad with chicken. Or a burrito bowl- basically a deconstructed burrito without the tortilla. Why? Well...not sure. Less messy? Feels like I'm being healthier somehow? Perhaps. Actually I think it's because I like seeing what I'm about to eat...sometimes with burritos you get an unsatisfying mouthful of lettuce. You know?

What I like is that they don't shy away from spice. Whatever they marinate that chicken in is really damn good. The turnover of the line always seems constant, due to high volume, and therefore always seems pretty fresh. I like that I can get mild, medium and hot salsa all at once if I want.  I also like that  I can drink free tap water with lemon in it. I usually dress my salad with a squeeze of lemon, some Chipolte Tabasco and a drizzle of their vinaigrette. Delicious every time. 

There always seems like there is way to many staff working here. There are only ever two people assembling the food, and one at cash...but then  10 extra people seemingly fooling around, joking, being generally loud in the background (and I don't mean those who work in the kitchen). Whatever. Seems like a fun place to work!

Another great and surprising thing about Chipotle is that the music is sometimes  fantastic and obscure. I often find myself happily 'Shazam-ing away, enjoying my food.

I've been raving about Chipotle for years! I kept telling my BFF (who lives in Toronto) that he is seriously missing out on life.  Because a life without Chipotle is no life at all.

During my most recent visit to Toronto (Jan 3-8), we were walking outside the Eaton Center and what do I notice?! A CHIPOTLE! HUH?! Where did this come from?!  So of course I insist we go there for dinner.  Oh, man. I was soooo freakin' excited. Finally, I get to share this love of mine with my bestie.

We go in and I explain how it works.  You get in line and tell the person behind the counter what you want (tacos, burrito, burrito bowl or salad). Then you choose your meat then all your toppings (free, with the exception of guacamole).  I always get a burrito bowl. With 1\/2 steak and 1\/2 chicken. Fresh tomato salsa, a little bit of red tomatillo, lots of corn, cheese, lettuce, and a side of chips. But wait! There was no fresh tomato salsa...or corn... or lettuce! What the heck. I seriously felt sad because my measly-looking burrito bowl was pathetic! Rice, meat, tad of red tomatillo and cheese.  LAME.  When we pay, I ask the cashier why they were missing so many ingredients and she says that their supplier was lacking in their delivery...

Okay, so seriously, we sit down in the crowded seating area and I dive into my burrito bowl.  It really couldn't really be that bad... afterall, the essential ingredients were still there... right?  Wrong, it was still bad. The chicken was BURNT and dry.  The thing just didn't taste the same without lettuce, tomato or corn.  Call me picky, but I was utterly disappointed.  My BFF, who got a burnt chicken burrito, said his was too spicy.  

So... after years of hyping up Chipotle to my bestie, I felt embarassed having said I was addicted to Chipotle. I guess I can't really blame them for the issue with their supplier... but come on... serving burnt chicken?!  That's just wrong!  You could clearly see it was charred on the edges and dry!  They should know better.

Despite being shown around Los Angeles -- a city full of phenomenal, authentic cheap Mexican food -- I honestly enjoyed my Chipotle burrito the most out of everything I ate while I was in L.A (also - never go to L.A. - worst city in the world).  I wasn't sure what to make of it - was Chipotle that good?  Or am I just crazy?

So - I went back home to Vancouver - a city where Mr. Chipotle didn't think it was profitable to open up a location.  The fact that I couldn't have it, made me want it more.

Add to the fact that my co-workers happen to live in states where there are Chipotles and a constant topic of discussion in our group chat was 'How good is this Chipotle?' while they enjoyed their burritos (partially to troll me) -- that was irritating to say the least.  Seriously - they went from discussing how great the new Thomas Keller restaurant is and then talk about how awesome their Chipotle was in the same breath.  Chipotle is that good or we're all just that crazy.

If I was Tantalus, it would have been Chipotle burritos above my head and Everfresh Grape Cocktail at my feet.

So - imagine my joy when I found out that Toronto not only had Chipotle, but there was on 5 minutes from my apartment -- perfect lunch distance.  I was so happy that I would feast on the food of the fast food gods again.

To begin - it's obviously not as good as I remember.  It's obviously not authentic -- but that doesn't necessarily make it bad.  The ingredients are fresh and it's tasty.  When you have one loaded up: overly salted and really rich?  Yup - but this is some damned solid fast food.

So - I stand by it: I like Chipotle.  Although for some reason, I feel a bit ashamed to say it.

If I had reviewed this pre-food poisoning, it probably would have been a 5-star rating. I literally would crave the burritos. Soo good.

I don't know why people think that this place is so unauthentic, while it may be, it's damn good. Not that I'm an expert at what authentic Mexican cuisine is but I'm pretty certain that it's similar. I assume it's like associated ManchuWok with real Chinese food but what would I know.

In any case, I love this place. The burritos are always the most massive things ever. Like a champ, I wolf down the entire thing, only to be left with the most massive food baby ever. But I never leave unsatisfied.

Inside is the basic, wooden topped stools\/chairs and metal counters\/tables. There is a serve yourself drink fountain as well, you can purchse beers and margharitas! That's always a plus when eating a burrito. 

The one thing that I would recommend is that they grill the burritos after. Every other burrito place that I've been to does this, why does Chipotle not? All they do is press the tortilla prior to adding the ingredients, essentially just heating it up so that it's more flexible to stuff. To really top it off, put some grill marks on there and it'll be near perfection.

I haven't been recently but apparantly the prices were raised $1, which is quite hefty for an already expensive burrito (it used to put you back $8) and if you factor in that guacamole is an extra $2, that'll set you back even further!

I've always had a good experience here, even though I walk out with a double digit bill, I feel like it's worth every penny. I won't have to eat for another 5 hours and for $10 that's okay with me.

1. Chipotle is 6.85$ in the states, but 8.95 here. I get it that there are different currencies, but they aren't that different.
2. This place is often very busy. You may encounter long waits at lunch and dinner. 
3. Because of the demand, customer service here is pretty bad. This location is like most McDonald's..they make so much money they don 't have to give a shit.  I admit to contributing to this dilemma by returning regularly.
4. Depending on who's making your order, you may get a very skimpy portion of rice, beans, and definitely meat. You must ask if you want veggies, and they always skimp on these.  It is almost comical watching them trying to either scoop a small portion or shaking parts of full scoops back into the bins. (Although this is probably right after they've been chewed out for being too generous.)
5. One of the soft drinks is usually unavailable at the beverage stand. Check this as you enter. It sucks to want a coke, pay 2$ for a small cup, then find out there is no coke.
6. Guacamole is a pretty hefty extra charge on a burrito that, while better, is already more expensive than BurritoBoyz who does provide guac. To get the most of the guac, order it as a side. You are charged the same, but tend to get a bit more.

I've experienced better.', 2-star is definitely the right option, because I have most definitely experienced better.

This was my first time going to Chipotle after some three years. The last time I had it, I remember really enjoying my burrito, and especially given the way people rave about Chipotle I was pretty excited to be eating there again - I was, however, quite let down. 

The two main fast food burritos I've had most recently are from Quesada (in Montreal) and Moe's Southwest Grill (in Atlanta), so naturally my expectation for Chipotle was based on these and I was definitely expecting better. What I got, however, was considerably worse for four main reasons:

1) Although they deserve credit for having a largely simple menu, which many places struggle with, it's so simple that they have only one type of tortilla, with no whole wheat option. Quesada and Moe's both offer whole wheat and white tortillas. 

2) There was a smaller selection of ingredients to choose from to put in my burrito. Moe's, as far as I remember, had the largest selection with options like grilled mushrooms and onions, and Quesada also had a selection larger than that of Chipotle. Chipotle only had a few simple options, no additional sauces and it seemed the entire time they were trying to hurry the process up too much. 

3) The way they readied the burrito. Chipotle first heats the tortilla, then puts all the ingredients inside and then hands you your burrito. The other two, on the other hand, heat the tortilla, insert the ingredients and then reheat the entire burrito so that even the ingredients it holds get nice and warm. I could tell from my first bite of Chipotle's burrito that the insides were cold. Cold rice, cold chicken and cold vegetables (although that last one is probably okay). 

4) The price. It's priced higher than the other two and it's not considerably larger. They also only have one size, which again is less flexibility for the consumer. 

Oh, and I could add here that Chipotle's burrito was considerably messier to eat than others I've had. But you could say that's very relative, so I'm open to disregarding it!

I tried Chipotle around 4 years ago on a trip to NYC. It impressed me then but I wasn't a big burrito guy like today.

I finally got around to trying Chipotle in the core the other day and man was I impressed.

Ill start off by saying no offense to the other fast food burrito joints in the city, you all have a special place in my heart, but you can learn a thing or two from Chipotle.

Ambiance:
Walking in, I heard and smelled the sound of chicken cooking on the grill. You see the vegetables being cut in front of you, freshness is in the air.
Other than that, typical fast food joint.

Food:
I am thinking of ways to describe it the food, but nothing comes to mind aside from Bombjiggy.
All the vegetables were delightfully fresh, nothing seemed to be sitting around.
I asked if I could get some jalapenos and they said Jalapenos stop after 5pm. Although not impressed, it shows some concern for the freshness of their food.

Now the chicken - man oh man - it was like backyard BBQ chicken in a burrito. Juicy and a little charred on the outside. amazing!!

Burrito Boyz et all, learn from this, your ingredients can be great, but chicken that's sitting around in a warmer all day is ruining your experience.
Cook the chicken throughout the day, focus on smaller quantities!
The chicken alone has won a place in my heart for best burrito so far. Sorry Big Fat B and the rest.

The burritos are MASSIVE.
My dear reader, this is not a snack or an in-between meal; there is enough to feed a giant or 2 adults. If you're starving it's plausible to finish on your own but regardless of the degree of starvation you feel the end result will always be the same: you're stuffed beyond your eyeballs.
Besides the physicality of the burrito, the nutrition in this is also a meal - for those interested, I believe it has something like 1300 calories in a single burrito + the complementary corn chips and dip? Prolly pushes over the recommended intake(That didn't stop me from eating this for a week).

So if you consider these factors- that you are really getting 2 or more meals in ONE, the $10 is pretty cheap.

I LOVE the fact that you can customize the degree of hotness and how quick they are despite the reDONKULOUS line up the always seem to have. no matter how many times you ask they are always friendly in explaining all the ingredients.

The mere fact they use the term Mexican in their brand is an insult to any foodie who is worth their salt and has had something even 1\/10 Mexican during their lifetime. I really have a beef when a place tries to pass themselves as authentic (as per their name) when they are so far off the mark. Basically, I do not like false advertising. 

Heck, I am not even Mexican and I am mildly insulted. Like calling a Falafel a vegetarian hot dog. Since in Mexico, what people call an authentic 'burrito' is just a taco with has refried beans or a meat and generally those are the only fillings, but since Americans like their food 'super sized' then they had to go an add a bunch of random fillings in order to Americanize the dish. Remember the rule of thumb, if it has cheese, rice, lettuce or sour cream, it is not Mexican.   

Anyway, all that aside, these wraps are alright if you are hungry and don't mind paying almost twice as much as it would cost you to get an arguably healthier option like a 12 at Subway.

At that price, it's more expensive than two premium Taco Bell burritos. This is important because there's a Taco Bell at Yonge\/College. Unfortunately, it's only slightly larger than one Taco Bell premium burrito. It looks slightly larger at first, but that's because it gives up height for width. None of the meat has any strong seasoning, so the toppings overpower any of the natural distinct taste that meat gets from grilling. You'll still feel hungry after you finish it, wondering why you wasted so much money on an average product.

The sides are an even larger ripoff. About four tablespoons of guacamole costs $2, or $1.70 if you get it with their tortilla chips. For a restaurant that prides on its environmental practices, I was surprised that the tortilla chips were all individually wrapped.

The one thing I don't like about this Chipotle, although I can hardly blame them for it, is the location.  Dundas Square is a place I consider to be malltown for tourists, rubes and other people that don't know anything about the city.  But with all the other mega chain restaurants in the area, and the heavy foot traffic down Yonge, I'm sure it seemed like a no-brainer to the number crunchers at Chipotle.

Most of us are sadly aware that Toronto has a terrible Mexican food situation, and even Tex-Mex or American influenced Mexican places are at a premium right now. Chipotle is the latter - mission style burritos done perfectly.  The menu is sparse on other accounts, because they do something right and don't split their focus with a lot of other entrees.  I hope that Chipotle can serve as a beacon or goalpoint for the current and future restaurants who want to serve burritos in this city - maybe they'll be a good influence.

There isn't anything special about this Chipotle that stands out from the others, but I thought I'd post a review since I took a picture of my last order.

The lines can get fairly long, but the service is quick and efficient and so it does move somewhat quickly (unless you get a lot of indecisive people in front of you - know your orders people before you reach the front of the line). I find the burritos too big to fit into my mouth and gets quite messy so I just ask for a burrito bowl. Extra meat is extra price, but feel free to ask for extra rice or veggies if you feel like you want more at no extra charge. I usually ask for extra rice to balance out the sauces and they're always fine with it. You can also mix-and-match the meat for free, they just give you less of each.

My primary concern is the consistency of the food. I've come here many times ever since it opened its first location in Toronto and I would say that the food is what I would expect 70% of the time. The rice sometimes is too salty, or too clumped that the flavours weren't distributed evenly. The chicken was once undercooked (!!!) but has a tendency to be a bit burned - my last order had a few burned pieces of chicken which made the entire meal bleh. I often get my food to go so it would be a bit tedious for me to walk back and ask them to remake the food, but I definitely would have if I was dining in. Perhaps a bit of quality control would be helpful in providing customers with a more consistent experience.

When I went home to call him and tell him I thought it was just okay he gave me a good yelling, you know that kind of yelling your Mom would do when you forgot to take out the trash?

I felt like I was in some special secret club. I sit down and question my friend why I have the bag of chips and the burrito bowl. My friend tells me mix the burrito bowl together and grab a chip and use the burrito bowl as a chip dip. I do as he says and I can not express the flavour explosion in my mouth.

I learned a bittersweet lesson today:  once you discover the awesomeness that is The Real Thing, you can never go back to the knockoffs.  On the upside, my recent trip to Burrito Boyz introduced me to Real Burritos.  On the downside, I can never return to Chipotle.

When I moved to Toronto, I was super-pumped about this Chipotle place I had heard about from a friend who had gone to school in the US.  She would drive from Toronto back to Cleveland on a Chipotle run because it was just so good.

I now see that she was crazy.

I first tried Chipotle about a year ago.  I made a lunch trip with some colleagues and thought at the time that this was one badass burrito.  I told friends about it, even dragged some of them there.  Since then, I've had Real Burritos elsewhere and Chipotle's lustre has faded.

Notwithstanding* my preference for Real Burritos, I decided to return to Chipotle today after seeing a recent, less-than-ringing endorsement by Kat Stimulus Package for the Toronto Hospitality Industry F., who noted unwieldiness and sloppiness.  I've had better burritos since my last Chipotle run, but I really didn't think the difference was that substantial.

It was.

The astute culinary historian will recall that Chipotle was once a part of the McDonald's empire**, where assembly-line efficiency and consistency are highly valued and where food is always yummy but rarely good.  While I was aware of this historical context during earlier excursions to Chipotle, its implications were not so readily apparent as they were today.  

Having had a Real Burrito to compare with not two weeks prior, the taste and quality were still fresh in my mind.  This placed me in an ideal position to finally see why a Chipotle burrito is not the real deal:

1:  Service standard.  Sulky, rushed kids slopping stuff around and wrapping it up.  I think four different people handled my burrito before it ended up in my hands***, and two of them mumbled so badly I couldn't hear them.

2:  Ingredients.  I have never seen such a dismal tub of pinto beans in my life.  There was as much broth as beans, making my burrito a bit soupy.  Pico de gallo was similar, and I feel like I got chintzed on the pulled pork.

3:  Finishing.  I never realized before what a difference grilling the burrito makes to its ease of consumption.  I learned last week that firming up the shell with a nice toasty crust gives the wrap some much-needed structure.  I suspect Chipotle burritos are so unwieldy and sloppy because they're not grilled.  

The burrito tasted good and was absolutely massive.  There was just the right hint of cilantro if you enjoy that sort of thing.  Apparently not all of us do****

My go-to order: 
-half chicken half steak burrito bowl with brown rice, pinto beans, corn, lettuce, cheese and sour cream

I recently discovered that sour cream makes a world of difference, it's SO much better with it. 

The service at this location is always on-point. Especially because of the location, there's always a line up but the staff get through it quick. My only complaint is that they generally don't give you much of anything and they rarely ever REALLY fill the bowl up for you.

My number one gripe is that the hot salsa isn't really hot at all. Much Tabasco was needed to make this burrito the level of spicy that I craved. Also you gotta pay extra for guac, which is just silly. Because how can you conceive a burrito without guac? 

There was just the right amounts of each ingredients in my burrito, and I didn't find any ingredient overpowering the other.

As I have been to several Chipotle stores in Orange County, I can say with confidence that this is a very disappointing Chipotle branch.

The portions appear to be quite a bit smaller than their US counterparts. Combined with the higher prices and taxes, it feels like a rip-off. 

Every other time I have come here, there is some supply problem with the chicken. This needs to be sorted. Chipotle stores in the US can handle large volumes of customers quickly and without supply issues. Not complying with customers' choice to pay with Interac, a standard payment method in Canada, is also a nuisance.

Chipotle offers some of the better, albeit slightly sterile and without a bunch of options, burritos in the city. It comes with a hefty price (nearly $9 per burrito), but it's easily enough for two meals. Fountain drinks come with free refills, and all the toppings are free with the exception of guacamole.

The staff usually means business, and is not the friendliest. I guess there's no time for that when you've always got a line up. Speaking of which, during lunch hour, you'll be lucky to find a seat. And it'll be a miracle to find one someone has dropped half a burrito over.

Thankfully, because it's incredibly busy the meat and toppings are usually fresh. Customers have full view of the meats, and can see what looks fresh and what might not have been touched. The carnitas seems to be the least favored, which is a shame, because it might be the most delicious.

There are a variety of other options beside burritos, like a 'wrap-less' burritos, which basically means you get everything dumped into a container. There are chips and salsa, although for the price you pay, it's not worth the portion.

Another thing I love about Chipotle is that when ever I'm there, you can always see the fresh food being barbequed and prepared. It makes me feel better about going there versus another less healthy option.

Although Chipotle isn't a good representation of how actual Mexican food tastes like, it's a nice place that allows you to select what goes into your meal.

I've tried both the burritos and the burrito bowls (I prefer the latter just because it's less messy), and the amount of food that Chipotle gives its customers is definitely sufficient for the amount you pay (which is around $10 after tax). I like how you get the option of choosing 2 types of protein (for instance, you can get half chicken and half steak) for the same price as 1 type. In addition, the staff is always friendly and efficient; the line-ups generally move pretty quickly.

I come here on occasion as the food isn't bad, it's a build your own meal style place that has many options from burritos, salads, tacos and bowls, that you pair with various salsas, and other toppings. Each option is $8.95 base + add ons. Protein options include chicken, steak, barbacoa (like a shredded bbq meat - maybe pork?), carnitas (pulled pork ish - more saucy than barbacoa), sofrita (tofu option), or veggie. As usual guac is extra but it is worth the extra $2.21. In my opinion the best bang for the buck is getting the bowl. Chips can also be had for an extra $1.20.

For a company that supposedly prides themselves on customer service, they sure fail to live up to their internal message. 

I ordered a bowl, and I am a paying customer, who simply asked for plain brown rice. The girl I had who was black, with a really bad weave (LOL) was completely rude to me. She rolled her eyes at me, and aggressively grabbed a new spoon and searched for the brown rice. She plopped on less than a spoonful of rice and looked at me like she had no idea what her job was.. I ignored her comical attitude towards me, and asked for more rice... You know, something at I am allowed to get, seeing how whenever I go to any other chipotle they are happy to give it to you.. But no, she was completely rude. And once again rolled her eyes. I couldn't believe what I seen. The management at that location is also questionable... Not everyone there but a specific few that I won't get into. Anyways, the cut sizes are awful in comparison to midtowns, chicken, steak lacklustre and lack adequate seasoning.

I like Chipotle overall, but haven't been to this location before.  My fave location is the one near Bloor and Bathurst.

I happened to be running an errand at the Stockyards, and Chipotle was very convenient to the parkade, so I figure I'd order taking before leaving the shopping centre.

When I entered, there were only a couple of folks dining, and no one in line.   My usual is a Steak Fajita Burrito Bowl.  They did NOT have steak ready, and I had to wait about ten minutes.  I was told to sit down, and that they would tell me when steak was ready.  I was asked if I wanted a drink, but I declined.  While sitting and waiting, there was a rush of people who came in to order.  After waiting some time and no on informing me steak was ready, I got up to check, and lo and behold, steak was ready, and almost used up!  Geez.

I ordered my bowl, and noticed that the meat servings at this location is not terribly generous.  Otherwise, the burrito bowl is what I'd come to expect of Chipotle.

You say that you have a craving for Mexican.  You've heard of this super awesome Mexican food chain in the US, that's finally here in Canada and you want to give it a try!  Well save your $20 and get yourself 20 tacos from Taco Bell instead, because Chipotle will disappoint you and your stomach will have nothing but regrets.

Let's start off by saying I've tried Chipotle in California and sure it was OK, but with the amount of authentic Mexican restaurants and food trucks there, I don't know why anyone in their right mind would eat Chipotle.  I guess it's like having that craving for Chinese food and hitting up ManchuWOK for their chicken balls special, it just doesn't make sense to me.

I decided to a little adventurous and instead of the usual burrito, I went with the multiple tacos option.  A little bit of chicken, pork and beef to mix it up and pretty much every topping available, because I like it messy.  That's an understatement actually, because what I was served was a few small tacos, with a mound of meat, vegetables and slop piled on top.  I wasn't able to actually eat my meal like a taco should be eaten, so I ended up using a fork and knife to consume my meal like the meat salad it was.

Was I full at the end, yes.  Did my stomach appreciate the mountain of slop I just shoved inside of it?  Well, let's just say I did have many regrets the next morning!  Overall, as sad as it sounds, I think I'll go with the Taco Bell option instead.

The staff here are still coming up to speed with all details of customer service, yet they are friendly and eager to help customers.

If you are new to Chipotle, the negatives (especially for the neighbourhood) centre around price. A burrito bowl and a drink costs 12.20, which is a fair deal for quality and portion, but still high for those accustomed to walking out the door at McDonald's for a hair under $9.


Here are a few hints...

1. Guacamole costs 2.21 extra. Debates rage as to why this is, and whether it is better to order this as a side or on top of a bowl. Know this going in and you will be ahead of any worries about this cost.

2. Sometimes (depending on the server) they will skimp on meat or not offer you the grilled veggies. It is ok to ask for a little more!

3. If you want it, ask. They will do half mild, half medium salsa. They will mix black and pinto beans for you. Etc.

4. The stainless steel container to the right of the soda fountain is unsweetened tea. If you like unsweetened tea or just want a low\/no calorie option, it is available, along with fresh-cut lemons.

5. They try to source ingredients locally. They also use hormone-free and humanely raised meats. They also have vegetarian options (sofritas?) which is surprisingly good.

6. You can park in the deck and enter from the back side of the store (as well as the side that fronts St.Clair Ave.)",2,2,0,"Chipotle Mexican Grill","1970 St Clair Ave W, Unit 109","Toronto","ON","M6N 0A7",43.6724886675,-79.4684521965,3.5,16,1,"Restaurants;Mexican;Food;Fast Food"

I was expecting a much larger burrito for the price I paid, which might be part of the reason for giving such a low review. I understand that they use organic products , and stuff like that, but it didn't cut it out for me. The only good part of the burrito was the tortilla and black beans, but everything else wasn't so good, decent yet very cold vegetables, oddly chewy beef (but well flavoured) and just an OK guac, which I was surprised by the fact that I had to pay extra for it. The dining space is not at all comfortable (especially when crowded) but the staff weren't bad, they had a cheerful attitude even though it was obvious I wasn't enjoying the experience so much.

Okay, whatever. That's their style of food. Lots of people like coriander. They can't cater to my tastes and that's fine. The only things I could get on my tacos were hot sauce, sour cream, and lettuce. Lettuce......... The teenager working there gave me THREE SHREDS OF LETTUCE PER TACO. How expensive is lettuce?!

The portions are extremely small compared to its other locations, you'll probably be getting 70% of what other locations give you for the same price.  Even when you ask for extra toppings, they will give you a few extra shreds of lettuce or cheese if any. The meat is was also not very fresh, had a steak bowl a twice the meat was barely warm.

I believe I've talked too much about the service because it is not what makes this location outstanding; the steak is cooked perfectly. I alternate between chicken and steak bowls but what I noticed when eating steak is it is very soft and tender, especially when you eat it with the pieces that have a little fat that is like jelly.

The line-up was sorta confusing.  There's no signage, so if you're standing in front of the cash register, you're on the wrong side!  There was a guy in front of me and we were both standing on the wrong side before we realised that was the end of the line.  No one redirected us to the other end.  :(

Workers were friendlier than the recent location in Niagara Falls, NY.  Girl at the end of the assembly line didn't know how to wrap a burrito and she ended up scrunching it together.

Anyways, this is about their Annex location.  Walked in here several weeks ago and got my fill. The young man serving me, very friendly and seemed genuine. The young lady cashing me out on the other hand, seemed nice but less sincere. 

The first burrito I had here was good. Delicious, in fact! It is such a large portion though that I had to save some of it for a little later. And because of all the juices it got my flatbread all soggy. This is certainly less than ideal eating conditions for a borrito. Perhaps, they should also sell them in half sizes? If they don't already. 

As I sat and consumed, I read my paper bag and learned their rice is sourced organically,  which is something I didn't know before. So it was great to learn that. 

The second burrito I had, unfortunately did not yield the same outcome for me. The rice was undercooked, as it was still a tad on the hard side. I know brown rice is generally chewy, but not like this, crunchy.

This restaurant is fairly new. It has probably been open for less than a year. It is bright with plenty of tables, stools, and chairs. I am not crazy about the stools, for you can't hang your coat up. You either have to wear it, or place it over your stool and sit on it. I chose the latter.

As I grow older and perhaps wiser, I end up taking the lead. I went up to the counter and just ordered away. No hesitation. I was hungry.

I ordered the soft corn tacos. You get three of them. I got to order a different meat in each of them, so I went with chicken, carnitas, and steak. I then got salsa, cheese, and guacamole on all of them. By the way, the guacamole is an extra $2.21. It is my type of place when prices end with a number other than 0, 5, 8, or 9. Yes, my undergraduate minor was in math.

Folks there are friendly, cheerful, smiley, and helpful. I wanted to pay for my meal with my debit card, but it is not accepted. You can only pay by credit card or cash. I went with the former. I also paid for my contractor colleague's meal, as I am the one on the team who can expense welcome lunches for new hires.

It was nice to sit down and chat with everyone. I loved the chicken and carnitas tacos. I didn't like the steak as much. The steak cubes were tough at times. By the time I got to my third taco, the salsa made my corn soft tortilla soggy. I ended up eating it with my fork. 

Most of my colleagues went for the burrito. It is humongous! The place does not offer any knives. I would either have to bring my own plastic knife, or take the burrito home to eat and be a slob in a private setting.

The food is fresh. The eatery also has fountain and bottle drinks.

No debit?  Only cash and credit, that is weird,  first time ever I've been told I can pay with visa but not with debit. 

And last off,  they didnt toast the burrito!  Not only did I miss the crispy shell I am used to,  the salsa and guacamole cooled off the whole thing,  was eating a cold burrito with cold unmelted cheese.

It wasn't busy at all there was one person ahead of me in line and one person behind me and that was it.. yet there was about 6 or more employees all crowded around frantically rushing through us. Why did it take 5 people to make one burrito? 

The first girl takes my order of a chicken burrito takes out a tortilla and then her job is done and its passes it to the guy beside her who puts on rice and beans and then starts asking me questions about what i want next but after I tell him everything please he passes it to someone else so I have to repeat myself.. he then has to go do something for the customer in front of me whose waiting on veggies for hers so he gives it to the girl beside him and she has to ask me again what I want. I tell her everything. Before I'm even done with her the cashier is now asking me what kind of burrito I have and as I'm distracted and talking to her I don't realize that the girl still hasn't heard that I wanted everything on the burrito and when I get home I start eating it and realize there's a bunch of things missing lol All of this was simply because we were being rushed along like there was a line of 20 people.. I'm so confused as to what this system was and why they think its working..

Pros: (aside from all that foolishness lol) 

- The serving sizes are quite large and everything I managed to get in my burrito was very tasty. I'm sure it would have been really good if I had gotten everything I asked for 3 times.
- The salad and bowl options are nice idea.

Cons: 

- The tortilla to filling ratio was off and because they don't throw them on the flat top after they're made they get soggy very quickly.
- Guacamole is $2.21 extra... that is absolutely ridiculous.. your advertised as a Mexican grill but you have to pay extra for the most Mexican thing you have? Dumb.
- The menu is so simple it's pretentious, and has names like sofritas, carnitas and barbacoa with no explanation under the names to tell you what they are.. so prepare to stand and have to have it explained to you when you get to the front of the line and then you'll have exactly 1.2 seconds to decide because 6 people are going to be waiting to rush you down the line lol",0,0,0,"Chipotle Mexican Grill","5089 Dixie Rd, Bldg B, Unit B1","Mississauga","ON","L4W 0E6",43.6374549,-79.6222846,3,8,1,"Restaurants;Fast Food;Mexican"

I always get the burrito bowls at Chipotle. Usually either chicken or steak. 

This location either always burns the meat, or over salts it. You're left needing to drink a lot of water to get it down. I also find the rice dry at times. 

You're better off going to either the Square One or Sherway locations, but I would not come here again.

I wanted to give this place 1 star, but customer service is great here, they do take their time with you so that's always nice.

Generous portions here with excellent customer service! Like seriously, this one worker went around during the busy lunch rush to make sure everyone was enjoying their meals - don't see that at other fast food establishments! 

Always quite a line during the lunch rush but service moves quickly. Only downside is debit is not accepted here, only cash\/credit. Also ample parking lot at this plaza (with a lot of other food options as well if you're with a picky group).

Also if you've never tried the sofritas before, give it a try even if you're not vegetarian! You won't be able to tell it's tofu :)",0,0,0,"Chipotle Mexican Grill","5089 Dixie Rd, Bldg B, Unit B1","Mississauga","ON","L4W 0E6",43.6374549,-79.6222846,3,8,1,"Restaurants;Fast Food;Mexican"
